# Piggy

This is a hobby project started by two brothers interested in supercharging their personal finance workflow. 

The name of the project is a play on the words "Piggy Bank Police".

There is a strong desire for mutual understanding and involvement with this hobby project, 
yet only one of us brothers is a career software engineer (the other a mechanical). 
As such, I'll be heavily commenting and documenting both directly in code and in markdown files
with the intent that this project can be a useful learning tool for someone with minimal software experience.

Accordingly, I will also include several markdown files with helpers that would otherwise be unnecessary and redundant.
